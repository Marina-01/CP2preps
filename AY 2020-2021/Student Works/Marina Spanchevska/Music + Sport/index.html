<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I am avid learner and love problem-solving. I seize every opportunity to hone my knowledge and seek to be a better version of myself everyday. My love for learning has been the primary motivating factor for me to learn programming as it is such a vast field. It has also cultivated my passion for learning and helping others with programming.</p>

  	<p>
  	Music is the art of arranging sounds in time to produce a composition through the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre.It is one of the cultural universal aspects of all human societies. General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound).</p>
