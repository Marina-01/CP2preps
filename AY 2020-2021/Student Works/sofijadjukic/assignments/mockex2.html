Slovenia has historically been the crossroads of Slavic,
Germanic, and Romance languages and cultures. Although the
population is not homogeneous, Slovenes comprise the
majority.The South Slavic language Slovene is the official
language throughout the country. Slovenia is a largely
secularized country, but Catholicism and Lutheranism have
significantly influenced its culture and identity. The economy
of Slovenia is small, open and export-oriented and has been
strongly influenced by international conditions.It has been
severely hurt by the Eurozone crisis which started in 2009.The
main economic field is services, followed by industry and
construction.
